Introduction

Welcome to Installation Manual for TurboFia, a video game that is based upon the popular “Fia med knuff” with an electrifying twist – powerups! This installation manual provides step-by-step instructions to help you set up TurboFia on your system.
Prerequisite software

Before installing TurboFia, ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

> Operating System: We would recommend using Windows 10/11, but any operating system (including macOS and Linux] that supports running the Java Virtual Machine should work.
> Java Runtime Environment (JRE): TurboFia is a Java-based game; make sure you have Java installed. We would recommend using JDK 21 (which contains the necessary JRE) as that is the latest LTS (long-term support) version. If you don’t have it, you can, for example, download it here. However, all versions including JDK 17 (the previous LTS version) and upwards are supported too!

Installation

Follow these simple steps to install TurboFia on your system:
Step 1: Download TurboFia

Click on the "Releases" section (to the right-hand-side of your screen) to find the latest version. Once you have selected the latest release, download the JAR file. At the time of writing you can find our latest release (TurboFia-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) here.
Step 2: Run TurboFia

Once the jar has been downloaded, you can simply double-click the application and enjoy the game!
